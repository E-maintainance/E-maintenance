               <h2>COMPREHENSIVE BRAKE CARE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD</h2>
               <p>Your brakes are one of your vehicle’s biggest safety components. They allow you to halt the forward momentum of your car or truck quickly and effectively, ensuring that no matter where you go, you can stop at traffic lights and round corners with ease, all without slamming into the vehicle in front of you. However, when your brakes are bad, a dangerous situation can be inevitable.</p>

                <section id="sec2">
                <p>Typically brake problems stem from worn brake pads or rotors. When you stop, your brake pads create friction to help slow your vehicle, while your rotors disperse heat to prevent your brakes from overheating. Both pieces are essential when it comes to functioning brakes. Fortunately, if either of these pieces are damaged, we can replace them.<br></p>
                    <p>You may also be experiencing brake problems because of low brake fluid. This fluid is responsible for turning the force you add to your braking system by pushing the pedal into amplified pressure that will actually slow or stop your vehicle. It also protects the internal metal components of your brakes from corrosion.</p>
