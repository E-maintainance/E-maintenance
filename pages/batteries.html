               <h1>Batteries, Starters And Charging</h1>
               <p>Imagine this. You’re running late for work. You finally make it to your car and turn the key in the ignition only to realize your battery is dead. It’s a strong, sinking feeling. We know, we’ve been there. You not only have to determine how you’ll get to work, but you’re probably left wondering how you could have a dead battery when you didn’t forget to turn off your lights or electrical system</p>
               <br>
               <p>First things first. Before accepting that your battery is dead, double check that it is properly secured in your vehicle, and that all cables and terminals are clean and connected tightly. A battery may still have life left to give if it stopped working because of a weak connection. And if you need help with jump starting your vehicle, read our step-by-step instructions here.</p>

                <h2>Dead or Weakened Battery Warning Signs</h2>
                <p>A common misconception about modern car batteries is that they’ll give you plenty of warning before they give out. While it is true that vehicles used to start slower and slower before a battery finally died, most modern batteries have evolved to work at full capacity until they just can’t anymore. Though it’s nice that batteries today function longer than they used to, you have to look for smaller signs that it may be on the fritz. <br><br></p>
